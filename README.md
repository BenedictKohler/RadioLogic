# RadioLogic

An online platform that allows doctors/dentists to share and edit patient's images with each other as well as send messages. Implemented in order to make collaboration 
between these professionals easier as well as allow them to neatly store their patients data and information.

Developed the backend with Node.js and a MySQL database and the Frontend with React, React-Bootstrap Styling and Canvas API for image editing.
